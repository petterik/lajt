# lime (or lajt, not sure yet).

Declarative datascript UI with om.next like libraries.

## Rationale
Library that aims to make creating UI's with datascript with om.next like libraries easier, better and faster.

Library will feature a declarative parser.
The parser will make it possible to create a reactive-like UI, where whenever data changes in the datascript store, the UI components that need updating will be updated.

The declarative parser might solve some problems with remote data fetching, as using datascript causes different problems as the default db format om.next uses.

ðŸ‘· Library is still in its initial design phase.
